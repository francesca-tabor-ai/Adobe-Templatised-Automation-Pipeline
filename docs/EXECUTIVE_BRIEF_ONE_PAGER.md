# Creative Automation Program — Executive One-Pager

**Regulated global brand · Governance-first · 9–12 months**

---

## What It Is

A **risk-managed, governance-first** transformation of content production: templated creative automation that keeps Legal, Compliance, and Brand in control while cutting production time 40–60% and eliminating compliance drift across markets.

---

## Why Board-Level

| Driver | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Regulatory risk** | Multi-market (EU, APAC, LATAM, MENA) requires strict review; automation must be a *controlled system*, not a free-form tool. |
| **Audit & liability** | Every asset must be traceable: what was approved, for which market, when, by whom. |
| **Scale** | Print, OOH, social, display, video at global scale is unsustainable as craft-only operation. |

---

## Objectives

1. **40–60%** reduction in creative production cycle time  
2. **Zero compliance drift** via central claim/disclaimer libraries  
3. **Controlled variant testing** within legal and brand guardrails  
4. **Full audit traceability** for every asset  
5. **Premium quality** preserved via locked brand layers and controlled variation

## How It Works (6 Phases)

| Phase | Duration | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **0. Alignment** | 1 mo | Automation Charter signed (CMO, Legal, Compliance); risk defined |
| **1. Data & variant model** | 2 mo | Enterprise Creative Data Schema; claim/disclaimer libraries |
| **2. Template engineering** | 3 mo | Print (InDesign), digital (Photoshop), motion (After Effects) |
| **3. Compliance gating** | 2 mo | Two-layer approval; full audit trail per asset |
| **4. DAM integration** | 2 mo | Auto-ingest, metadata, “Approved for Publish” workflow |
| **5–6. Pilot + rollout** | 2–3 mo | 3 pilot markets → global rollout |

**Total: 9–12 months**

## Governance in Practice

- **No free-form text** in automation — claim selection only from Legal-approved library  
- **Automatic expiration** of claims and disclaimers  
- **Market-level permissions** — variant eligibility from central rule matrix  
- **Version-locked templates** — changes require governance approval  
- **Manual override** — any exception logged and auditable

## KPIs for the Board

- Asset production time reduction (%)  
- Compliance rework reduction (%)  
- Legal review time reduction (days)  
- Variant scalability (per campaign)  
- Audit completeness score  
- Cost per asset reduction  

---

## Strategic Outcome

Creative moves from **distributed craft operation** to **governed production engine**: industrial-scale variants, full traceability, market agility, and controlled experimentation — **board-ready and audit-ready**.
